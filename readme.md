# App for tracking expenses

This app is the finishing task from a udemy course i did (https://www.udemy.com/react-2nd-edition/) by Andrew Mead.
It covered many topics including React, Redux, Webpack, Babel, Git, Github, Testing, Firebase, Authentication with firebase and many more things.
I learned HTML, CSS and Javascript with different books and did another Javascript course over at udemy (https://www.udemy.com/modern-javascript/).
I used the basics of this app to edit it for my use. You can have a look at https://github.com/JAsbahr/cards-table
Any feedback is gladly appreciated :-)
